# DevProject

A project aiming towards improving testing measures and preventing the spread of COVID-19 by keeping track of social interaction in the real world and making it easier to see the chain of carries of the virus. Using its WiFi network, a location such as a shop can keep track of individuals who enter and the duration of their stay. Supposing an individual who has visited the location gets infected, a list can be pulled up containing the identity of other individuals present during the time of stay.
