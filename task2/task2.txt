Program inputs CNIC and then reads text file created via task1, sorting CNICs, numbers and arrival/departure times into separate arrays. The program first outputs the number and arrival/departure time of the CNIC that was entered. Then, for each CNIC, the program checks if the individual arrived within the time frame in question or departed during it. CNIC, numbers and arrival/departure times of individuals meeting the criteria will be displayed as output.
